### This proyect is still not ready for a stable build. I'm working on it on myself but PR's are welcome.
## How to build:
### Prerequisites:
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

### Steps:
1. Clone the repository.
```bash
git clone www.github.com/Sellsword9/tinksoul
```
2. Go to the repository folder.
```bash
cd tinksoul
```
3. Install the dependencies.
```bash
npm i && cd src-tauri && cargo build && cd ..
```
4. Make some needed folders. (May be fixed)
```bash
mkdir temp && mkdir brains
```
5. Build the app.
```bash
npm run tauri dev
```


Icon notice: The icon of the app is needed for the thing to compile and work. 
Short version:
The logo is made with AI. I own it. You can use it. Don't trademark it.
Long version:
I have updated to the repository a icon image I made with AI. It is NEEDED for the app to build, as of now.
You can use the same logo as long as you don't trademark it.
According to OpenAI terms, I own it, so no problem.
Legally speaking, as I own the icon, I ask you to not trademark it and then sue me for using my own icon, please. 
Consider the fox thing as a logo for the app, temporary. I will change it later, maybe.
